## Last Week's Accomplishments

> update learning process in https://github.com/VictoriaGuXY/MCO-Menu-Checker-Online/tree/master/Learning

> more use of JSONEncoder and JSONDecoder -> [python_json6.py] 

> use of JSON in Python and the convertion between them -> [python_json7.py] 

> how to save a JSON file and read a JSON file adn use of dump/dumps and load/loads -> [python_json8.py] 

> the basic data analyzing strategies using Python,
  two ways to read a csv file: pathway and URL, and
  how to output data and save them into a csv file -> [python_data_analysis1.py] 

> how to read Mysql data -> [python_data_analysis2.py] 

> how to read and write an SQL -> [python_data_analysis3.py] 

> how to extract and filter data we need, use of dataframe (df), and
  use of .head(), .tail(), .columns, .index, ix[,], iloc[,], iat[,] .drop(), .shape -> [python_data_analysis4.py] 

> If we want values with constraints or features, how can we extract these values -> [python_data_analysis5.py] 

> methods to do descriptive statistics and sort the data based on a feature, and
  more use of df.describe() and df.sort_values() -> [python_data_analysis6.py] 

> methods to deal with the missing values in a dataset (delete it or use other value to replace it) 
  -> [python_data_analysis7.py] 

> methods to group data based on specific column (feature) -> [python_data_analysis8.py] 

> how to substitute a data with another data and substitution of columns -> [python_data_analysis9.py] 

> data analysis:  p-value, t and variance,  Student's t-test, paired sample, and
  how to let two sets of data have different variances by setting equal_var=False 
  -> [python_data_analysis10.py] and [python_data_analysis11.py] 

> variance analysis using levene(), f_oneway(), and
  multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) -> [python_data_analysis12.py] 

> use of sympy, sage and z3 to solve functions in Python 

> data structures in python: array() and deque(), and the use of tofile and frombytes -> [data_structure1.py ]

> use of heapq and dictionary and how to find largest and smallest elements in them -> [data_structure2.py ]


## This Week's Plan

> learn more on python data structure

> learn something new and update the notes in Learning folder

## Anything Blocking?

> set up environment for computing and graphing

## Notes

> IMPORTANT NOTE:
  I forked my own copy of the project's repository BotUsers/MCO-Menu-Checker-Online to my online
  account as VictoriaGuXY/MCO-Menu-Checker-Online. Now in this repository, I created a new folder
  called Learning to record the learning process. It contains codes that I learnt during the 
  project.
