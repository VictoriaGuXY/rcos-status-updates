## Last Week's Accomplishments

> forked my own copy of the project's repository to my online account to separate the master
  branch of the project with my own learning process

> learn to use the python library called Demjson

> learn to use demjson.encode() method to parse Python object into JSON -> [python_json3.py]

> learn to use demjson.decode() method decodes a JSON-encoded string into a Python object -> 
  [python_json4.py]

> learn to handle a custom type and convert it to json using two methods. 
  The basic idea is to convert a custom type to dict type in python. 
  method1: write my own method of convertion -> [python_json5.py]
  method2: override JSONEncoder and JSONDecoder type. [python_json6.py]

> more details of learning are saved in Learning folder described in the Notes section below

## This Week's Plan

> learn more on JSONEncoder and JSONDecoder

> learn something new and update the notes in Learning folder

## Anything Blocking?

> Since I am not very familiar to the use of JSONEncoder and JSONDecoder, I will learn more on
  these next week.

## Notes

> IMPORTANT NOTE:
  I forked my own copy of the project's repository BotUsers/MCO-Menu-Checker-Online to my online
  account as VictoriaGuXY/MCO-Menu-Checker-Online. Now in this repository, I created a new folder
  called Learning to record the learning process. It contains codes that I learnt during the 
  project.
